# Hello, I'm Siddharth 👨‍💻

I'm a curious generalist aiming to be a modern-day polymath. Most of my work revolves around the application of AI — especially Machine Learning and Deep Learning — in both STEM and the humanities.
Many of my projects are driven by the intersection of these domains.

I'm building a portfolio of my projects here: [siddharth7113.github.io](https://siddharth7113.github.io)

I'm most responsive on **Twitter** and **Email**—feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat, collaborate, or just geek out.

###  Fun Fact

When I'm not writing code, I'm probably:

- Binge-watching something.
- Looking at math behind some algorithm, or
- Deep-diving into LLMs (Large Language Models).
I'm well aware of the cognitive offloading effects—and the risks of overuse—but I can't deny I'm hooked. Consider me a fascinated skeptic, or maybe just an informed addict.

_No em-dashes does not mean LLM output, I sometimes purposely use them,but in this case ,the inverse is true. :P_
