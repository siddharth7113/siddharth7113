# Hello, I'm Siddharth 👨‍💻

I trying out stuff

I'm building a portfolio of my projects here: [siddharth7113.github.io](https://siddharth7113.github.io)

I'm most responsive on **Twitter** and **Email**,feel free to reach out if you'd like to char or collaborate,

---

When I'm not writing code, I'm probably:

- Binge-watching something.
- Looking at math behind some algorithm, or
- Deep-diving into LLMs (Large Language Models).

_No em-dashes does not mean LLM output, I sometimes purposely use them,but in this case ,the inverse is true. :P_
